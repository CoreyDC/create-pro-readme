# Create Pro Readme

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to create an application a developer can use in order to quickly and easily create a professional readme file. This application speeds up the process of building a readme by using node.js. While building this application I learned how to use node.js and the inquirer extention. Building the app taught me how to use the .prompt method and how to write a file from scratch.

## Installation

To install this application you will need to download virtual studio code or another code editor, setup your ssh keys, and copy the git repo into your local machine. 

## Usage

After you copy the repo into your machine, you will want to make sure you have node.js downloaded and installed as well. After that you open your integrated terminal in your code editor and run node index.js to run the application. Below is a video example:
